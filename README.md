WYGIWYS Right IT Editor
=====================
This is a simplest formatted text editor ever! Everybody knows, that nowdays readers such as iReaver, Kindle and some of Apple products can convert mess html pages (blogs/newslaters) to fine-readable text with smooth styles. What We want to do is give to people simplest editor for formating text in correct way. All styling will be addited automaticaly. You can also include your own theme for editor. As example, in iPhone notes looks like real exercise book.
The best article is that other peoples without this editor also can edit this files, but only in durty way (inline editing), becouse in output always will be text. 

P.S.: All images can be putted as base64 ebbeded content only inside .html (.mht/.mhtml) files.

Supported file types/formats:
------------------------------------------
For me, BB, HTML, Textile, Latex and Markdown - it`s all looks the same. We chosed the Markdown for the general format, becouse it seamplest of both above.

* Plain text documents: .txt .md (.markdown) (.tt) .textile .tex (.latex) .bb .html .mht (.mhtml)
* Archives: .zip .tar .bz .rar .7z archive export plugins for grouping files with external images and/or styles?
  * filename_files/
  * filename.[format]
* Formatted text documents: .wri .rtf .doc .docx .odt .pdf import/export plugins?
